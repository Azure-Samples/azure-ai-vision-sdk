# üåç Localization

The Azure AI Vision Face UI SDK embraces global diversity by supporting multiple languages, enabling you to provide a localized experience that enhances user interaction based on their language preferences.

## üìö Supported Languages

By default, the SDK is set to English (en-US). However, you can customize it to support additional languages by providing locale-specific string dictionaries.
Currently, we have translations to the following locales:
