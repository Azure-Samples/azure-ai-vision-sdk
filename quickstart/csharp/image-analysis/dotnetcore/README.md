# Quickstart: Image Analysis (C# .NET Core, Windows x64 & Linux x64)

This sample demonstrates how to run Image Analysis on an image file on disk or an image URL, using Microsoft's C# Azure AI Vision SDK for Windows and Linux.

Note that the Image Analysis Vision SDK is in private preview. APIs are subject to change. The SDK is not yet available to the public.

Only Windows 10 (or higher) x64 and Linux x64 versions are supported at the moment, via a NuGet Vision SDK package.

For Windows x64, follow the instructions [here](README-Windows.md)

For Linux x64, follow the instructions [here](README-Linux.md)
