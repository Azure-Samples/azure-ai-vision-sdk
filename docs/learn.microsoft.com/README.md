# Source code integrated into Microsoft documents

This folder contains source code that is integrated (embedded) in Microsoft's [Computer Vision ducumentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/).

It is formatted to fit those documents, with little source code comments and less functionality. It also includes "tag" comments such as `// <snippet_single> ... // </snippet_single>` that are used by our document build system to embedded source code in published documents.

Please see the sources code under the [samples](/samples) folder instead for the full set of samples, with source code comments and supporting setup, compile and run instructions for multiple platforms.
